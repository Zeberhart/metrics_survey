        %h2 Introduction
        %p Hello, and welcome to our Java comment-rating study! The purpose of this study is to learn how programmers perceive the quality of source code comments.

        %p Your job will consist of two alternating phases: 

        %p In the first phase, you will be shown the source code for a Java function, as well as a source code comment describing that function. You will carefully read the comment in the context of that function, and rate the quality of the comment in terms of three criteria. We will explain how to judge these criteria in the following section.

        %p In the second phase, you will be shown the same function and comment, as well as an additional comment. You will carefully read both comments, and then rate the similarity between the two comments. We will also explain how to make this determination in the following section.

        %br

        %h2 Guidelines
        %p This section provides instructions for determining ratings for the source code comments. Your ratings will indicate your level of agreement with statements about the comment's quality. You will be able to select from the following options: "Strongly Disagree," "Disagree," "Agree," and "Strongly Agree." We provide examples of comments that might earn certain ratings, but do not provide specific instructions for differentiating between different tiers of agreement. It is ultimately up to you to determine your level of agreement with each statement. 

        %p The examples refer to the following function:

        %pre
            %code.language-java.function="public int compareTo(final FCAElementImplementation other){\n\treturn this.contextPosition - other.contextPosition;\n}" 

        %h3 Statement 1: Independent of other factors, I feel that the summary is accurate.
        %p A comment is considered "accurate" if its description of the function is factually correct, and "inaccurate" if the description is false. Even if the comment fails to mention key information about the function (such as important functionality, usage scenarios, constraints, etc.), as long as the information that is stated is clearly correct, it is considered to be accurate.

        %h3 Statement 2: The summary is missing important information, and that can hinder the understanding of the method.
        %p Important information helps a user to understand when, why, and how to implement the function. If you can comprehend the function by simply reading the signature and skimming over the source code without even reading the comment, then the comment may not need to elaborate much; however, if the purpose, functionality, or intended usage of a function are unclear from the code itself, then that would be considered "important" information for the comment to contain. A comment can contain all important information about a function, even if it contains some incorrect or unnecessary information.

                %p Some functions and comments may take longer than others to read, comprehend, and rate. A typical pace is 1-1.5 minutes per function. It is important that you take a moment to comprehend what each function actually appears to be doing, as some comments may include correct keywords but incorrectly describe the key functionality. 
            %li
                %p After you've completed your first 15 comments or so, please check your pace -- if you have taken greater than 25 minutes or less than 10 minutes, consider spending more or less time on each function.
            %li
                %p Stop working if you begin to feel fatigued. You may take a short break and continue, or resume at another time. Do not work for more than 90 minutes without taking at least a 10-minute break.
            %li
                %p Some comments will be gramatically-incorrect, contain placeholder tokens, or mention classes, concepts, or other elements that are not present in the code itself. Nevertheless, do your best to evaluate the text as shown. 
            %li
                %p You may return to this page at any time to view the examples, but don't spend too much time trying to iron out small distinctions -- when in doubt, go with your gut feeling.

        Your work will be used by software engineering researchers to better understand the language used in source code comments. Thank you very much for your participation in this study!
